# Gear-Position-Sensor-Display

## Code to read a resistive Gear Position Sensor (GPS) and output the current gear position to either a Seven Segment display or an 8x8 Dot Matrix.

In both versions the resistance is read between common ground and each of the red & blue wires.

### Seven Segment:
The seven segment version displays to a single digit seven segment display.
A protoype can be seen below:
